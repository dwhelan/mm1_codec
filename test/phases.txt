Phase 0
A functional MM1/MO "shock absorber" working in a development environment.

Our goals are:
 - to build a functional tap with a Kafka message bus to absorb peaks in load.
 - to build effective tests for the system
 - to gain insights into how to build and test event-based systems
 - to build a CI pipeline
 - to share learnings across UC
 - solidify a backlog for staging and production phases


Phase 1
A functional MM1/MO "shock absorber" working in a staging environment.

Our goals are:
 - build and deploy a working shock absorber into a production like environment
 - extend CI pipeline to be a CI/CD pipeline
 - use Docker containers for ease of build and deployment
 - health monitoring
 - support functionality (logs)
 - security


Phase 2
A functional MM1/MO "shock absorber" working in a production environment.

Our goals are:

Outcome
 - shock absorber released to production as a canary release with controlled volumes from < 1% to 100% of MO traffic
 - learn how to deploy an event bus in production
 - learn how to operationalize an event based system
